## Cropper

This is a horrible **HORRIBLE** C program that I play around with to learn a bit more about the language.

### Why did you make this?

I literally just made this to crop my avatar:

I could have just used GIMP or even the built in image viewer, but where's the fun in that?

### What does it do?

I mean... technically it crops images, but... That's giving it too much credit.

Just don't bother looking around, I'm just playing around with C and C++.
